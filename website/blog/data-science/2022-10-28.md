 ## Setting up and Python Basics

 Welcome to week 2 summary for the #30daysOfDataScience. The week that was we covered cleaning our data and visualizing. 
 
 The Data Science process begins with getting your data. Real world data is often messy. You might encounter some missing values, duplicated data, or data not in the right format. For example, if someone fills in the same form twice, how do you mitigate this? As we went through the data preparation session, we learnt to import our data, the different libraries we needed and how to locally install them and finally how to utilize the libraries.

 ## Data Visualization.

We have learnt a new language, worked on our data and now we might want to share with the world the journey we have gone through. The first thing is sharing your data story. In this section we cover data visualization, what charts can you use where and how to create meaningful charts

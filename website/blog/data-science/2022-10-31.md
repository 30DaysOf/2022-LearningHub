# Machine Learning

Machine learning is often the foundation for an AI system and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data. It automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data.

**Regression models:** If you want to predict the probable height for a person of a given age, you'd use linear regression, as you're seeking a numeric value.

**Clustering models:** they help you make sense of chaos and is part of unsupervised learning. In a professional setting, clustering can be used to determine things like market segmentation, determining what age groups buy what items, for example.

> In this week, we learn how we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

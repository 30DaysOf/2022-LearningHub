## Welcome! 

Hello and welcome to the launch of the #30DaysOf learning hub. 👋🏽

This is a collaborative effort within Developer Relations to collect and share various resources that support self-study and structured learning for beginners and experienced devs alike. Technology changes fast! The only way to adapt, and thrive, is to learn continuously - and apply learnings to practical problems.

So, what does that learning journey look like? Think of it as four stages:
 * **Welcome** - the onboarding phase, to set you up for success! 
 * **Guide** - the exploration phase, where you pick the learning path to follow.
 * **Connect** - the community phase, where you meet & help others on that path.
 * **Share** - the pay-it-forward phase, where you share insights for future travelers.

## Your First Learning Actions

Where should you start? 

1. 👋🏽 - [**Take a minute to introduce yourself**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/3)  What are you looking to learn? What are *you* an expert in? Which region are you joining us from?
2. 🗓 - [**Check the calendar**](/calendar) - look for upcoming or in-progress learning journeys (e.g., #30Days) and join in! Work at your own pace, or look for events and discussions where you can interact with other learners.
3. ⏰ - [**Cultivate learning habits**](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html) - Use techniques that help you learn to learn better. Take breaks, switch between focused and relaxed modes, practice what you learn, and understand that each person learns differently.
4. 🎯 - **Set a goal** - And keep moving towards it one step at a time. Connect with others in your community to get help, or feel inspired. Then pay it forward - more on that in the next section.


## Your First Learning Contributions

Did you know that **writing things down** can help reinforce what you learned, and help you review or recall it much later? And that **sharing notes and insights** with others is not only a good way to contribute back to the community, but also help your career by building an online profile? As part of your learning journey, consider 3 ways in which you can contribute to others learning journeys (and your own):

 * [**Use our Discussion Boards**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions) - share notes, ask questions, or answer them.
 * [**Share your Articles**](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/issues/new/choose) - use the _🐝 Community Buzz_ template to submit links to us.
 * **Build Open Source Projects** - then write about it, and _Share your Articles_.

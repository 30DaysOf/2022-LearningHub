## Welcome! 

Hello and welcome to the launch of the #30DaysOf learning hub. üëãüèΩ

This is a collaborative effort within Developer Relations to collect and share various resources that support self-study and structured learning for beginners and experienced devs alike. Technology changes fast! The only way to adapt, and thrive, is to learn continuously - and apply learnings to practical problems.

So, what does that learning journey look like? Think of it as four stages:
 * **Welcome** - the onboarding phase where you get setup for the journey. 
 * **Guide** - the resource exploration phase, where you pick the path to travel.
 * **Connect** - the community phase where you interact with others on the same journey.
 * **Share** - the pay-it-forward phase where you share your learnings to help the next traveller.

## Your First Actions

Where should you start? 

1. [Take a minute to introduce yourself](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/3) - What are you looking to learn? What are *you* an expert in? Which region are you joining us from?
2. [Check the calendar](/calendar) - look for upcoming or in-progress learning journeys (e.g., #30Days) and join in! Work at your own pace, or look for events and discussions where you can interact with other learners.
3. [Cultivate learning habits](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html) - Use techniques that help you learn to learn better. Take breaks, switch between focused and relaxed modes, practice what you learn, and understand that each person learns differently.

Most importantly, **set a goal and keep going towards it one learning step at a time** - connect with others to get help or feel inspired. Then pay it forward by sharing blog posts and showcasing your apps, so others can learn from _you_.

We can't wait to see what you learn - next!

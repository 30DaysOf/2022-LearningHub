## Hello Day 3! 

Check out what we tackle today. But before that, here is what you have done so far _(You can catch up with the others if you are a step behind ...)_

1. Joined the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/ConnectorSkillsChallenge)
1. Created a [M365 & Power Apps Developer Account](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/recap-of-day-2-onboarding-session-30days-of-learning-nigeria/ba-p/3490280?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-juliamuiruri)
1. Talked to us on our [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16) 😇


## Day 3: Summary
We have just built a connector from scratch with you today and I'm sure you agree that it's a fun and easy process, right? <br />
But why are we doing this? 
### Connector Usecase


---

Team XYZ (a fusion team) comprises of a **Business Manager** (citizen developer building low code solutions on Power Platform), **IT Admin**, **Researcher** and **Pro-Dev**. 
The **Researcher** has identified a new External Service (with a free & public API) that would greatly benefit their Business goals and they would like to access it directly from their system. However, the **Business Manager**, building the low code solutions lacks the coding background to use the API endpoints directly from his solution.
The **Pro-Dev** therefore steps up to fill in the gap by building a connector to wrap the API and publishes it to the organization's environment. The **Business Manager** then uses this connector to access the external service, helping the team hit their business goals and everyone is happy.

Every person's role on the Power platform towards digital transformation.

What is a connector? **Note: Connectors allow you to not only access Microsoft products, but also external services**
![Connector definition](../fusion/img/connector-def.png)

Custom connectors are used to:

- Add services not currently supported
- Expand an exisiting connector that doesn't have the trigger/action you want to use

### Step-by-step - Build a connector
**Step 1:** 📖 Read the Docs/ know the API you want to build a connector for.

**Step 2:** Start in one of the products (Power Apps, Power Automate or Logic Apps). You can choose one of the following options to start building your connector:

1. [Create one from blank](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/define-blank?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri). See example of the [SWAPI API (Star wars)](https://youtu.be/CMCuNYVW4B0)
1. Create from Azure Service _(Preview)_ - Super useful when using Azure API Management
1. [Import an OpenAPI File](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) (version 2)
1. Import an OpenAPI from URL
1. [Import a Postman collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/define-postman-collection?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri). Learn how to [Create a Postman collection for a custom connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/create-postman-collection?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri)
1. Import from GitHub

**Step 3:** 🔐 Set up the Authentication

**Step 4:** ⚡Define the operations (triggers/actions) for your connector. The action you want to create **MUST** be implemented by the API

**Step 5:** [Add code if needed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/write-code?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) (for now C# code is supported)

**Step 6:** ✅ Save and test your connector

⚠️ _When you build your connector, ensure you hit **save button** to avoid loosing all your work_
📝 If you want your connector to be used across different environments, create it within a solution

![Connector types](../fusion/img/connector-types.png)

Finally. these tools will help you build connectors:
- [Paconn CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/paconn-cli?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) - Add ALM (_Application Lifecycle Management_) to your custom connector
- [Power Platform Connectors VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/ppc-vscode)
- [Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/powerplatformcli)

## Your First Actions
1. **Gear up:** You need to set up a Microsoft 365 Developer Account and Power Apps Developer Account for you to able to create your custom connector. Learn how to do this for free [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/recap-of-day-2-onboarding-session-30days-of-learning-nigeria/ba-p/3490280?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-juliamuiruri)
1. **Join the Challenge Today:** Don't be left behind in the learning, this [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/ConnectorSkillsChallenge) contains modules that will give you skills to successfully work on a connector while you compete with your peers for awards.
1. **Check out the [Microsoft Power Platform Connectors Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri)** Your projects at the end of the program will go in the ['independent-publisher-connector'](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/independent-publisher-connectors/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) folder. 

## Day 1: Summary
As a code-first developer, where do you fit in the Low Code/No Code (LCNC) Environment (Power Platform)?

![Fusion Team Development Process](./img/fusiondev-process.png)
### Fusion Teams - Roles & Responsibilities
Fusion Teams Empower everyone to do more. A code first developer builds an API, which can then be made into a connector and in turn, connectors can be made into drag and drop components to be used by citizen developers in low code solutions
  1. Citizen Developers
      * Understand the business
      * Solve their own challenges using Technology

  2. IT Professionals
      * Enable high productivity app development.
      * Implement governance and compliance.

  3. Professional Developers
        * Reduce time to develop and deploy.
        * Use code to unblock complex requirements.

### Participation Options
1. Identify an [existing connector on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/independent-publisher-connectors/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) and improve it!
1. Use an already deployed API to build a connector! [Recommended]
1. Build an API from scratch, deploy it and build a connector using it!

* All independent publisher contributors are advised to go through the [Independent publisher certification process guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission-ip?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) before building & submitting their connectors
* Participants who opt to improve existing connectors can ONLY improve connectors in the [Independent-Publisher-Connectors](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/independent-publisher-connectors/?WT.mc_id=academic-73999-juliamuiruri) folder in the repository

### Incentives & awards
** All participants ** who submit a working connector will receive the [M365 Platform Community - Independent  Publisher 2022 Badge](https://www.credly.com/org/m365pnp/badge/m365-platform-community-independent-publisher-2022) to add to their CV/portfolio

** 5 Cloud Skills Challenge Random Winners ** will be awarded with a special SWAG Pack

** The Top 4 Connectors ** will each receive the Hackathon Grand Prize

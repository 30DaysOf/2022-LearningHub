## Hello Day 11! 

We are fast approaching the hackathon and today we tackled how you validate your connector after you create it. But before we get into that, here is what you have done so far _(You can catch up with the others if you are a step behind ...)_

1. Read the [previous summary blog](https://microsoft.github.io/30daysof/blog/fusion-meet-an-independent-publisher/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-juliamuiruri)
1. Joined the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/ConnectorSkillsChallenge)
1. Created a [M365 & Power Apps Developer Account](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/recap-of-day-2-onboarding-session-30days-of-learning-nigeria/ba-p/3490280?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-juliamuiruri)
1. Signed in to https://make.powerautomate.com/ or https://make.powerapps.com/ and attempted your first connector. [See how to start on the SWAPI connector here](https://youtu.be/CMCuNYVW4B0)
1. Talked to us on our [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16) ðŸ˜‡
1. [Provided any product feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16#discussioncomment-3650962) from the documentation, services, tools that you have used throughout the program. _(Is any learning material missing? Is the documentation difficult to understand? Are you getting unexplained errors? Is anything not working? **Let us know about it**)_

## Day 11 Summary: Validating your connector & Best Practices
[Mahbub Murshad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmurshed/), A Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft took us through how you validate your connector and talked through some of the best practices to observe when building connectors.

**Goal:** We are going to fix the [Facebook custom connector](https://github.com/juliamuiruri4/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/dev/custom-connectors/Facebook?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-juliamuiruri) so that. when someone posts on your facebook timeline, you receive an email
We will also cover a demo on **Paconn** and **pac cli**

_ðŸŽ‰ So far we've seen how to create a connector from scratch, from an Open API definition file and today, it is exciting to learn how to create one by importing it from GitHub._

### Pre-requisite 
- Install python & run 'pip install paconn'
- VS Code

### Connector Best Practices
![Connector best practices](./img/connector-best-practices.png)

1. Treat your connector as code and version control because its possible to make mistakes when doing everything on the UI 

1. With the CLI, you can have different versions of your connector on your local PC and it becomes easier to upgrade your connector.

1. When a full schema is not required for the connector, use smaller schemas

1. Always ensure you write a good descfeription for your connector

1. Avoid a large connector. In the case where you are working with a bulky API, split the connectors in API groups, but then still be cautious not to have too many splits

1. Use version in the API path. Example:

        "paths": {
          "v1.0/groups/office365": {
            "post": ...
          }
        }

1. Understand connector limits. For example:

---
- You can have 1000 connectors per subscription
- You can send 500 requests per minute, per connection
- You can have 512 schemas in a swagger (definition of requests & responses)
- You can have 256 operations in a swagger

### Next Steps
- Head over to https://make.powerautomate.com/ and start today!

- Check out the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/paconn-cli?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-juliamuiruri) on Microsoft Power Platform CLI

- Build your first connector, share on Social media and tag us to celebrate your learning!

:::success READY? LET'S GO! ðŸŽ‰
Day 18 (Thursday 29th) >> Join us at 7PM EAT, to learn the steps you need to take to submit your connector to GitHub and learn about the certification process!

Keep sending in your connector proposals. [See instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/30daysof/discussions/16#discussioncomment-3719781)

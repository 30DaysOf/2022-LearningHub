## Kickoff 
Millions of tons of data are being generated everyday. Businesses want to extract meaning from this data so they can use it to:
* Increase revenue
* Reduce Cost
* Optimize processes
* Improve Customer Experience and Satisfaction

By skilling up on [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), you will be able to help organizations like this achieve their goals.

### A Dose of Motivation
_Data is the new oil and I live in an oil country where nobody is drilling --- Olanrewaju Oyinbooke (2019)_. I am so happy right now that I can share a quote that inspires me so much at the early stage of my career. Interestingly, this quote is also by myself. 

You will agree with me that in Nigeria and Africa, we havenâ€™t gotten the best value from the data around us yet and that is exactly what this track is trying to solve. By equipping you to be able to fill this gap. Did I just say Gap? Yes, there is a Data Gap.

### What is a Data Gap?
Data Gap is a way to represent the rate of data generation versus analysis. Daily, Data are being generated at an exponential rate but only few are being analyzed. What could cause this gap? a very obvious reason is unavailability of technical-know-how. we have fewer skilled data analyst compare to the available data.

To better understand the volume of data generated daily, let us check this  data never sleeps chart by domo.

This huge data gap means opportunity. as predicted by Microsoft, between 2020-2025, there will be 43million job roles in the data analysis and related role space. This will however favour only the skillful and not beginners.

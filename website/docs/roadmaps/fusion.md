## Kickoff 
Organizations today are embracing ‘fusion development’ to drive digital transformation in their businesses. A fusion development team brings together Pro Devs, IT admins, citizen Devs, researchers, and business managers to collaborate in building transformative technological solutions. This #30DaysOfFusion - Microsoft Connector Hackathon Pilot Program, welcomes you to contribute in building power platform connectors that will make it possible for low code developers to connect to as many external data sources as they would need.

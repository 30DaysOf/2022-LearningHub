## Kickoff 

From Feb-Mar 14th, 2022, over 30 days, we published articles that aimed to introduce developers to [Progressive Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/. 
 * The content covers 0-level to 200-level topics. 
 * Each post should take you 5-10 minutes to read.
 * Each is followed by a sample snippet or exercise. 

You will need some basic web development knowledge to follow along. We hope that beginners will quickly pick up the content and that experts will also learn a few new things.

The Roadmap is structured into 4 themed weeks:

* **Core Concepts**: Learn the fundamentals of PWA.
* **Advanced Capabilities**: Know Project Fugu and relevant APIs.
* **Developer Tools**: Explore end-to-end tooling support for PWA.
* **Platforms & Practices**: Adopt best practices for PWA.

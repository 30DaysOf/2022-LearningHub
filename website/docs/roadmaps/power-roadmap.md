# Roadmap

:::info #30DaysOfPowerPlatform
This is a 30days learning curriculum curated by Cloud Advocates at Microsoft focused on empowering you with the knowledge and resources to build enterprise applications, automate processes, build beautiful external-facing websites and build intelligent bots without code within minutes using Microsoft's Power Platform.

:::

## Kickoff 
Did you know? According to IDC, by 2025, 500 million more apps will need to be created. That’s more than all the apps we have built in the last 40 years. On the brighter side, this presents us with an enormous opportunity.

Sadly, there aren’t enough professional code-first developers to go around for the volume of work ahead to modernize businesses. Developers are already slammed with a long technology to-do list of tasks and are being asked to fundamentally reinvent how the business works. 

To bridge this gap and reduce the workload, many developers and organizations have relied on low-code and automation. The rate of such automations will increase at a faster rate in the next 5 years, and we need to get you ready for this.

## What is Microsoft's Power Platform?
Microsoft's Power Platform is a low-code and automation tool built to empower everyone to build solutions, regardless of their coding abilities. It comprises of 5 power tools:
- Power Apps: Used by 92% of the Fortune 500 organizations, Power Apps enables you build enterprise applications within minutes without writing a single line of code
- Power Automate: With the ability to now connect to 750+ applications and services, Power Automate enables you automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks and processes.
- Power BI: 
- Power Pages: This new member of the Power Platform family empowers you with the ability to build beautiful external facing web applications.
- Power Virtual Agents:

Throughout this entire 30days, our focus would be on Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents and Power Pages.

## Lesson Plans (In Progress)

| Topic / Link | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Unit 1: [Introduction To Realities](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-1-introduction-to-realities)  | This unit explains the differences between each of the realities that XR encompasses, which devices support each of the realities and how to make the choice as to which reality will work best based on the necessities of a project. |
| Unit 2. [Core Concepts](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-2-core-concepts) |This unit covers foundational concepts necessary to understand developing for an immersive 3-dimensional environment. Some of these concepts include how to make digital objects behave like real ones and how to ensure that users are comfortable while interacting with an XR application. |
| Unit 3. [Spatial Design](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-3-spatial-design) |This unit explores the design process for creating XR apps and introduces the benefit of creating spatially aware objects. |
| Unit 4. [Interactions](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-4-interactions) | This unit introduces the basics of user-application interaction in XR. From hands and controller-enabled operation to gaze functions, XR offers a wide array of possibilities when it comes to interacting with digital objects and applications.|
| Unit 5. [https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-5-c-foundations](C# Foundations) |This unit serves as an introduction to programming using the C# (C Sharp) language. Although there are multiple languages that can be used in XR development, C# is one of the most commonly used due to its prevalence in the Unity Engine (which is the chosen engine for this curriculum). |
| Unit 6. [Unity Fundamentals](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-6-unity-fundamentals) | This unit introduces the fundamentals of Unity development. Unity is a cross-platform development engine, which provides different avenues to develop XR applications and games. The Unit Activity starts the creation of the basketball game app.|
| Unit 7. [Create App Logic](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-7-create-app-logic) | This unit introduces how to use scripting to create logic for an app. This unit also explores additional Unity features such as the input system, the physics engine, and creating UI. The Unit Activity continues the creation of the basketball game app.|
| Unit 8. [Capstone Project](https://microsoft.github.io/xr-development-for-beginners/#/?id=unit-8-capstone-project) |This capstone project serves as an opportunity to demonstrate what youâ€™ve learned over the course of the curriculum. For your capstone project, develop an XR application to be deployed to your XR device of choice. |
